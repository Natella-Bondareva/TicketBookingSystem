##Future Improvements
To increase the usability and real-world applicability of the project, the following enhancements are planned:

Smart schedule creation for administrators
Add recurring schedules (e.g., every two days or every Tuesday) to reduce repetitive manual entry and improve administrative efficiency.

UI/UX improvements
Enhance the user interface and booking flow for better usability and user experience.

Database refinement
Improve relational logic and normalize the structure for better performance and data consistency.

Expanded testing
Add more unit and integration tests to ensure stability and reliability in edge cases.

##Motivation and Learning Outcome
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:

Full-stack application flow from database to front-end

REST API design and client-server communication principles

Working with relational databases and modeling relationships

Debugging and solving problems using .NET and Entity Framework
