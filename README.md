Features:
+Search for routes with intermediate stops
+Booking and reservation system
+RESTful API with role-based logic
+Admin panel (in progress)
+Responsive front-end using React
+PostgreSQL database with relationships
+Secure login and registration

Technologies Used:
Backend	Frontend	Database	Others
ASP.NET Core	React	PostgreSQL	Git, REST API

✅ Current Status:
This project is a work-in-progress. The core booking logic is implemented, and the main functionality is working. Next steps include improving UI design and adding automated tests.

Future Improvements
To increase the usability and real-world applicability of the project, I plan to enhance the system with the following improvements:

+Smart schedule creation for administrators
Add recurring schedules (e.g., every two days, or every Tuesday) to reduce repetitive manual entry and improve usability for admin users.

+UI/UX improvements
Enhance the front-end design and layout to make the booking flow smoother and more intuitive for users.

+Database refinement
Improve relational logic and normalize structure for better performance and data consistency.

+Expanded testing
Add more unit and integration tests to ensure the system behaves reliably under edge cases.

Motivation & Learning Outcome
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:

+Full-stack application flow

+REST API design and client-server communication

+Working with relational databases and entity relationships

+Debugging and problem-solving in .NET
